Analyze_Fitness_Data: 

Find_S cacluates the coefficient of selection of a query strain using time-course compettive growth assay flow cytometry data. This script is based on inputs generated by FlowJo in the following format: 

**Note - when reading in data - stringsAsFactors=FALSE!!

Sample Count Gated_pop'n
A02..  1000  xxxx

A Well Key must be provided in the following format (column names must match): 

Well_ID		Experimental	Reference	Gated.on
A02...		strainID	strainID	strainID

Strains can be named anything you'd like. Replicates MUST match for all values other than Well_ID. 

To run: 

Results<- Analyze_Fitness_Data(Well_key, Flow_Data)

Group replicates (TRUE/FALSE): 

The well key supplied will be used to look for any duplicate competitions. If TRUE, grouping replicates will treat all competitions with identical well key identifiers as biological replicates. 

If false, each sample will be treated individually. 

Replicates MUST be named identically in the well key. 

Error estimation (TRUE/FALSE): 

If you have multiple replicates (i.e. your well key contains multiple rows of the same "assayID"), the script will find the standard error of regression and 95% CI by regressing using all data points within a replicate. 

Replicates MUST be named identically in the well key. 

If you do not have replicates of individual competitions (i.e. your well key "assayID" column contains no duplicate names), this method will assign each fitness measurement an error based on the error of regression for each individual sample. 

Plot(TRUE/FALSE): 

For no replicates, each sample will be plotted individually with error bars corresponding to 95% CI. 

If you have replicates, each replicate will be plotted as one point with error bars corresponding to 95% CI
